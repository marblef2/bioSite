				I have lived at my place of residence for about 15 years. During that time, I have found that I enjoy doing home improvement
				projects. One of the largest projects that I have completed is completely gutting the second level of the house, and replacing
				the wire, as well as spray foam insulating the walls and roofs so that way I don't have a lot of heat loss.
			</p>
				
			<p>
				Some of the other things that I like to do are to knit and crochet. The place that I typically do that is at a bar.
				this gives me some peace from the animals that I have around the house. Like one day that I came home from work and found two of
				my dogs, had ripped into the love seat so I grabbed my crochet project that I was working on and went to the bar and had a few drinks
				before I went home and dealt with it.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				As you can see, they really tore up the love seat. In the next picture the brother and 
				sister are playing and rough housing on my bed. The love to wrestle on the bed, especially if I am trying to go to bed.
				It is fun to try and sleep when they have lots of energy. It is also fun to take the dogs for a walk, 
				thankfully I have a roommate that is willing to help me take the dogs for a walk so that way 
				I am not getting pulled in three different directions at once.
